# Chapter 2: Vector Addition in CUDA

This directory contains the implementation for Chapter 2 of "Programming Massively Parallel Processors" focusing on the vector addition example, which demonstrates the fundamental concepts of CUDA programming including memory management, kernel execution, and thread hierarchy.

## Files
- `vecAdd.cu`: Complete CUDA implementation of vector addition C = A + B
- `mm2.md`: Mental model and conceptual understanding of vector addition in CUDA
- `concepts2.md`: Key concepts and theoretical understanding from the chapter
- `SUMMARY.md`: Brief overview of the vector addition example

## Compilation and Execution

To compile the CUDA code:
```bash
nvcc -o vecAdd vecAdd.cu
```

To run the executable:
```bash
./vecAdd
```

## Key Concepts

### Memory Management
- **Host Memory Allocation**: Using `malloc()` to allocate memory on the CPU
- **Device Memory Allocation**: Using `cudaMalloc()` to allocate memory on the GPU
- **Memory Transfer**: Using `cudaMemcpy()` to move data between host and device
- **Memory De-allocation**: Using `free()` for host memory and `cudaFree()` for device memory

### Thread Hierarchy
- **Blocks**: Groups of threads that can cooperate through shared memory and synchronization
- **Threads**: Individual execution units that perform computation
- **Grid**: Collection of blocks that form a complete kernel launch
- **Thread Indexing**: Using `blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x` to calculate unique thread IDs

### Kernel Execution
- **Kernel Launch**: Using triple angle brackets `<<<numBlocks, threadsPerBlock>>>` to launch kernels
- **Boundary Checking**: Using `if (i < n)` to ensure threads don't access out-of-bounds memory
- **Error Checking**: Using CUDA error checking functions to catch and report errors

### Computational Pattern
- **Data-Parallel Computation**: Same operation (addition) performed on different data elements simultaneously
- **One-to-One Mapping**: Each thread processes one element of the input vectors

## Design Considerations and Trade-offs

### Block Size Selection
- **Thread Scheduling**: GPUs schedule threads in warps of 32, so block sizes should be multiples of 32
- **Occupancy**: Larger block sizes can lead to better GPU occupancy up to hardware limits
- **Resource Usage**: Larger block sizes use more registers and shared memory per block

### Memory Access Patterns
- **Coalesced Access**: Sequential threads access contiguous memory locations for optimal bandwidth
- **Boundary Conditions**: Using conditionals to handle cases where array size isn't evenly divisible by block size

### Error Handling
- **CUDA API Error Checking**: Checking return values of CUDA API calls to catch errors early
- **Kernel Error Checking**: Using `cudaGetLastError()` to detect errors from kernel execution

## Performance Considerations
- **Memory Bandwidth**: The vector addition is memory-bound, with computation-to-memory-access ratio being low
- **Transfer Overhead**: Memory transfers between host and device can be a bottleneck
- **Computation Complexity**: Simple arithmetic operations benefit from GPU parallelism when processing large datasets

## Modern AI/ML Context

### PyTorch, JAX, & MLX Connection
- PyTorch tensor operations like `tensor1 + tensor2` are implemented using optimized CUDA kernels similar to vector addition
- Element-wise operations in neural networks (addition, multiplication, activation functions) follow the same pattern
- The memory management concepts in this example are fundamental to how PyTorch handles GPU tensors

### LLM Training and Inference Relevance
- **LLM Training**: Vector addition is a basic building block for operations like residual connections in transformers
- **LLM Inference**: Element-wise operations during forward pass utilize similar parallelization techniques
- **Quantization**: Operations on quantized models often involve vector additions for zero-point adjustments

### Bottleneck Analysis
Understanding vector addition is critical for addressing bottlenecks in AI/ML:
- **Memory Bottleneck**: Large tensor operations in LLMs require efficient memory access patterns similar to those in vector addition
- **Compute Bottleneck**: While simple, vector addition helps understand the balance between computation and memory access
- **Transfer Bottleneck**: Understanding host-device memory transfers is important for efficient model training and inference

## Implementation Details

The vector addition implementation performs:
1. Host memory allocation and initialization with mathematical values (sin² and cos²)
2. Device memory allocation
3. Memory transfer from host to device
4. Kernel execution with appropriate grid and block dimensions
5. Memory transfer from device to host
6. Result verification on the CPU (checking that sin² + cos² = 1)
7. Memory cleanup

The verification step takes advantage of the trigonometric identity that sin²(x) + cos²(x) = 1 for all x, allowing for accurate verification of the parallel computation.
