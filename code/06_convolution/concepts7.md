# Chapter 6: Convolution in CUDA - Key Concepts

## Core Concepts

### Convolution Operation
- **Mathematical Definition**: A convolution is a mathematical operation that combines two functions to produce a third function, expressing how the shape of one is modified by the other
- **Discrete Convolution**: In digital signal processing, convolution involves summing the element-wise products of a filter and overlapping input regions
- **Filter/Kernel**: A small matrix of weights that is applied across the input data to perform feature detection or image processing
- **Sliding Window**: The process of moving the filter across the input data to compute output values

### Memory Hierarchy and Optimization
- **Global Memory**: The main device memory, slow to access but large capacity
- **Constant Memory**: Read-only memory with cache, optimized for uniform access patterns across all threads
- **Shared Memory**: Fast on-chip memory shared among threads in a block, used for data reuse
- **Memory Coalescing**: Ensuring adjacent threads access adjacent memory locations for optimal bandwidth

### Tiled Processing Strategy
- **Tile Decomposition**: Breaking large inputs into smaller tiles that can be processed independently
- **Halo Regions**: Extra border elements around each tile needed for computation at tile boundaries
- **Memory Trade-offs**: The additional memory needed to store halo regions versus the benefits of tiling
- **Block Configuration**: How thread blocks are sized to include halo regions for proper computation

### Synchronization and Coordination
- **__syncthreads()**: Ensuring all threads in a block reach the same execution point before proceeding
- **Cooperative Loading**: Threads working together to load shared data efficiently
