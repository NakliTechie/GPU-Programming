## Overview
CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA for general-purpose computing on GPUs (GPGPU). This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts that underpin GPU programming and the CUDA architecture.

## Key Concepts

### Host vs. Device Architecture
- **Host (CPU)**: Controls the application flow, performs sequential tasks, and manages memory transfers
- **Device (GPU)**: Executes parallel computations across thousands of cores, specialized for data-parallel tasks
- The CUDA programming model defines how these two components interact to perform computation

### GPU Execution Model
- **Threads**: Thousands of lightweight threads run in parallel on the GPU
- **Warps**: Groups of 32 threads that execute in lockstep, forming the basic scheduling unit
- **Blocks**: Collections of threads that can cooperate through shared memory and synchronization
- **Grids**: Collections of blocks that form a complete kernel launch

### CUDA Memory Hierarchy
The GPU has a complex memory hierarchy designed for high-bandwidth parallel access:
- **Global Memory**: Large, high-latency memory accessible by all threads
- **Shared Memory**: Fast, on-chip memory shared between threads in a block
- **Registers**: Fastest memory, private to each thread
- **Constant & Texture Memory**: Specialized read-only memories with caching
- **Local Memory**: Per-thread memory for local variables that don't fit in registers

### Programming Model
CUDA uses a single-program, multiple-data (SPMD) model where:
- Host code manages data and launches kernels
- Device code (kernels) is executed by thousands of threads in parallel
- Programmers explicitly manage data movement between host and device

### Design Considerations
Key design considerations for effective GPU programming:
- **Memory Coalescing**: Ensuring threads in a warp access contiguous memory locations
- **Occupancy**: Maximizing the number of active warps to hide latency
- **Divergence**: Minimizing conditional branching within warps to avoid serial execution
- **Workload Distribution**: Balancing computation across all GPU cores effectively

## Modern AI/ML Context

### PyTorch, JAX, & MLX Connection
- PyTorch uses CUDA kernels under the hood through its C++ backend for GPU operations
- `torch.cuda` module provides utilities for GPU memory management and device control
- JAX offers XLA compilation to CUDA for high-performance numerical computing
- MLX (Apple's framework) implements similar concepts for multi-chip execution

### LLM Training and Inference Relevance
- **LLM Training**: Massive matrix operations in neural networks (attention, feed-forward) are highly parallelizable on GPUs
- **LLM Inference**: Batch processing of tokens and speculative execution leverage GPU parallelism
- **Memory Management**: KV-cache storage and attention mechanisms require efficient use of GPU memory hierarchy
- **Model Parallelism**: Techniques like tensor slicing, pipeline parallelism, and data parallelism utilize multiple GPUs

### Bottleneck Analysis
Understanding GPU architecture is critical for addressing bottlenecks in AI/ML:
- **Compute Bottleneck**: Modern LLMs require trillions of operations; GPUs provide the parallel compute power
- **Memory Bottleneck**: Large models require efficient use of HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) and caching strategies
- **Communication Bottleneck**: Multi-GPU training requires optimized collective operations (all-reduce, all-gather)
- **Latency Bottleneck**: Inference requires careful scheduling to minimize end-to-end latency
